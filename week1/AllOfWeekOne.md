Week 1: Basics of Backend Development and Setting Up Node.js
Day 1: Understanding Backend Development
What is Backend Development?

Backend is everything that happens behind the scenes of a web application. It’s responsible for processing requests from users, performing actions on data, and sending responses back to users.
Backend Roles include handling data storage, processing logic, managing authentication and authorization, and defining routes for APIs.
Backend vs. Frontend:

Frontend (Client-Side): The user interface (UI) that interacts directly with users, made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Backend (Server-Side): Handles data processing, logic, and storage, usually with programming languages like JavaScript (Node.js), Python, or PHP.
Core Backend Components:

Server: Software or hardware that receives requests from the client, processes them, and responds. We'll use Node.js as our server environment.
Database: Stores data that the server needs to access or modify (like user info, app data). We’ll eventually explore MongoDB for this.
API: An interface that allows different software to communicate. We’ll build a REST API (Representational State Transfer API),
 where each endpoint represents a specific resource and method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for interacting with it.
HTTP Basics:

HTTP Methods:
GET: Fetch data from the server.
POST: Send new data to the server.
PUT: Update existing data on the server.
DELETE: Remove data from the server.
Status Codes:
200: OK
404: Not Found
500: Server Error

Day 2: Setting Up the Environment
Install Node.js and npm:

Visit nodejs.org, download the latest stable version, and follow the installation steps.
Verify installation by running:

node -v   # Should return the version of Node.js installed
npm -v    # Should return the version of npm installed
npm (Node Package Manager) helps manage packages (libraries or dependencies) that we’ll use in our project.
Creating Your First Node.js Project:

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project folder, and initialize a new Node.js project:
bash
Copy code
mkdir myFirstBackend
cd myFirstBackend
npm init -y
This creates a package.json file, which stores metadata about your project and its dependencies.
Understanding package.json:

This file keeps track of your app’s metadata, scripts, and dependencies.
Key properties include name, version, and dependencies (which we’ll add as we install libraries).
Day 3: JavaScript Refresher
Running JavaScript with Node.js:

Create a new file named app.js with:
console.log("Hello, Node.js!");
Run this file by executing node app.js in your terminal. You should see "Hello, Node.js!" printed.
ES6+ JavaScript Features:

Arrow Functions: A shorter syntax for functions.
const greet = () => console.log("Hello!");
greet();
Template Literals: Using backticks (`) to create strings with embedded variables.
const name = "Node";
console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
Destructuring: Extract values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.

const person = { name: "John", age: 30 };
const { name, age } = person;
console.log(name, age);
Modules: Import and export functionality between files. We’ll use this extensively in building our backend.
Day 4: Creating a Simple Server with Node.js
Understanding HTTP in Node.js:

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) allows the client (like a browser) to request information from the server.
Request/Response Cycle:
A client (browser) sends a request to a server, asking for data.
The server processes the request and sends a response (usually data) back to the client.
Building a Simple Server:

Create a file named server.js and add the following code:
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello, World!\n');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
Run this file with node server.js, then open http://localhost:3000/ in a browser to see "Hello, World!"
Day 5: Introduction to Express
Installing Express:

Run npm install express in your project folder to add Express, a popular web framework for Node.js.
Creating a Basic Express Server:

In server.js, replace your current code with:
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from Express!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Express server running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
Run this server and open http://localhost:3000/. You should see "Hello from Express!"
Comparing Plain Node.js HTTP to Express:

Express simplifies routing and request handling, making it easier to build larger applications by providing built-in methods for routing and middleware.

1. What is Middleware in Express?
Middleware is a function that has access to the request (req), response (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. Middleware functions can modify the request and response objects, execute code, and call the next middleware in the stack.

Middleware Flow
A request comes into the server.
Express looks for matching routes.
Middleware functions are executed before the route handler (unless explicitly skipped).
If a route is found, the handler executes; if not, Express returns a 404 response.

2. Types of Middleware
Built-in Middleware: Provided by Express, such as express.json() and express.static().
Third-Party Middleware: External packages, like morgan for logging or cors for handling cross-origin requests.
Custom Middleware: You write these yourself to add specific functionality (like logging, authentication checks, etc.).
